HireHappy | Unlocking Fair Hiring, we empower gig workers helping access to insurance unemployment and benefits that grow with them

Despite the global rise of independent workers, more and more workers around the world are in ‚Äúnon-standard employment relations‚Äù, in which they are paid to complete specified tasks within a certain time. This new labour market poses challenges to social insurance, benefits systems in general and unemployment insurance in particular.

In the case of a layoff in a standard employer-employee relationship, the employer certifies that the layoff has occurred, that it‚Äôs involuntary and, in some countries, how much an individual has worked, to determine benefit eligibility. In a non-standard relationship, it‚Äôs only the worker who can inform the unemployment insurance agency about these things.

At HireHappy, we strive to empower gig workers by offering them the support they need to thrive in an ever-evolving landscape, with a firm belief that people should always come first, we prioritize employee well-being above all else, ensures fairness in hiring but also fosters a positive work environment that leads to better retention and performance for any business.
